       - Chapter outline (8-12 chapters, each with 3-5 key points)
       - Unique angle (how this is different from competitors)
       - Page count estimate
       - Price point

    2. BONUS 1 (checklist/worksheet):
       - Title
       - Content outline
       - How it complements the main product

    3. BONUS 2 (quick-start guide):

    5. UPSELL (advanced guide or video training outline):
